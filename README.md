For learning github flow

# Following [Github hello world exercise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

# Branching creates different, coexisting versions of a repository

# Helpful for add new features without changing the main source of code

# Work on different branches won't show up in main branch until you merge it

# Use branches to experiment and make edits

# Branch is a copy of the main branch (from the point in time you made the branch)
